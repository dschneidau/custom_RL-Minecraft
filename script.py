In summary, the agent receives the state, the gating mechanism uses its self-attention mechanism to determine which policy best aligns with its long term planning and passes it to the deep-MRT. The deep-MRT uses its memory component (CNN and RNN) as well as a goal orineted self-attention mechanism to pass Q-values to SARSA along with the diminshing rewards. The model then uses SARSA and epsilon-greedy strategy to output the predicted action based on the long term goal. The actions that the gating mehcniasm takes are also long-term-orinted. The weights of these functions are all updated during the training phase using reinforcement learning.

In this system, the agent first receives the current state of the game, which is Minecraft in this case. The state information is then passed to the gating mechanism, which uses its self-attention mechanism to determine which policy best aligns with the agent's long-term planning. Once the best policy is selected, it is passed to the deep-MRT (memory augmented neural network). The deep-MRT uses its memory component, which includes both a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) to process the state information along with a goal-oriented self-attention mechanism. The deep-MRT then generates Q-values which are passed to SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) along with any diminishing rewards. SARSA then uses an epsilon-greedy strategy to output the predicted action based on the long-term goal. The actions that the gating mechanism takes are also long-term-oriented. All the weights of these functions are updated during the training phase using reinforcement learning.

The flow of data for the agent to choose an action in Minecraft based on its state would go as follows:

1. The agent receives the current state of the game, which includes information about the environment, the player's inventory, the player's health, etc.

2. The state information is passed to the gating mechanism, which uses its self-attention mechanism to determine the best policy that aligns with the agent's long-term planning. For example, if the agent's goal is to build a house, the gating mechanism may determine that the best policy is to gather wood and mine for resources.

3. The selected policy is passed to the deep-MRT, which uses its memory component (CNN and RNN) as well as a goal-oriented self-attention mechanism to process the state information. The deep-MRT then generates Q-values based on the state, the policy, and the long-term goal.

4. The Q-values and any diminishing rewards are passed to SARSA. SARSA uses an epsilon-greedy strategy to determine the action that the agent should take next, based on the Q-values and the current state.

5. The agent takes the predicted action and the game's state updates accordingly. The agent's new state is then passed back to the gating mechanism and the process repeats.

6. The weights of all functions are updated during the training phase using reinforcement learning.



Example of how this would work in practice:--------------------------------------

Let's say the agent starts in a forest and wants to build a house. It will be hungry so it will want to gather food first.
The agent's state is passed to the gating mechanism, which determines that the best policy is to gather food before gathering wood and other resources.
The deep-MRT processes the state information and generates Q-values for the different actions the agent could take (e.g. gather food, gather wood, mine for resources).
SARSA uses the Q-values and the epsilon-greedy strategy to determine that the best action for the agent to take is to gather food.
The agent gathers food and the game's state updates to reflect this.
The new state is passed back to the gating mechanism and the process repeats until the agent has gathered enough food and resources to start building a house.
